# What is an NFT?
## Have you ever wondered how your data is kept safe when it is transmitted over the internet? In this blog post, we explore the fundamental concepts behind symmetric and asymmetric-key encryption, shedding light on the key differences between the two and how they are used to secure online communications.

NFTs are a new digital asset class built on [blockchain](https://natureblocks.com/blog/what-is-blockchain) technology that take advantage of [cryptography](https://natureblocks.com/blog/what-is-cryptography). NFT stands for non-fungible token. If something is fungible, it can easily be replaced or interchanged. Therefore, if something is non-fungible, it cannot easily be replaced or interchanged. **Non-fungible tokens are tokens that exist on [blockchain](https://natureblocks.com/blog/what-is-blockchain)s that cannot be replaced or interchanged**. Each token is unique, and all of its previous transactions are traceable on the [blockchain](https://natureblocks.com/blog/what-is-blockchain) that each exists on.

## What is minting?

For something to become an NFT, it needs to be minted. **Minting is the process by which a digital wallet is linked to a [blockchain](https://natureblocks.com/blog/what-is-blockchain) network, and then the NFT itself is assigned its ownership**. Once the NFT is part of a [blockchain](https://natureblocks.com/blog/what-is-blockchain) network, speculators can see previous transactions, who minted it, and when it was minted. The process of NFT minting is a lot like minting a physical coin.

> For example, a physical coin is evaluated for its precious metal concentration and then minted with the concentration data, allowing speculators to hypothesize its value. Similarly, a non-fungible token is assessed for its intrinsic value and any data it contains, then minted as a token on the [blockchain](https://natureblocks.com/blog/what-is-blockchain), allowing speculators to hypothesize its value.

NFT minting processes vary slightly depending on the [blockchain](https://natureblocks.com/blog/what-is-blockchain) infrastructure they use.

## What is tokenization?

Tokenization is the process by which something becomes a token. In data security, **tokenization refers to exchanging sensitive data for nonsensitive token data**, allowing the new tokenized data to be used in a database or internal system without exposing the sensitive data. Algorithmically generated numbers replace sensitive data, and these numbers are the actual tokens.

> Any business that stores credit card information securely has a process for tokenizing that sensitive data so that they cannot access it directly. Still, its token form is stored in a database for accessibility. This process reduces the risk of data breaches and simplifies customer payment experiences.

## What are some use cases for NFTs?

Non-fungible tokens have many different use cases. For example, unlike a cryptocurrency which is a divisible unit of account, non-fungible tokens have individual values based on sentiment around the particular token. However, like cryptocurrencies, [blockchain](https://natureblocks.com/blog/what-is-blockchain) technology allows non-fungible tokens to have authenticity, integrity, confidentiality, and ensures they are non-repudiable.

> The most common NFT use has been for showing authentic ownership of digital art. Numerous projects have released profile picture collections (PFP) for social media minted as NFTs so that only the owners can prove authenticity. Another interesting use case is for event tickets. Concert goers are digitally assigned non-fungible tokens upon their purchase of a ticket. A concert ticket NFT could contain data on section, seat, exclusive area access or even be redeemable for merchandise.

**NFTs can be traded, bought and sold**. Online NFT marketplaces allow speculators and investors to interact with markets for non-fungible tokens. These auction markets allow the process of price discovery to assign NFTs speculative values based on sentiment and previous transactions. NFTs can also have multiple owners, each holding some stake in the token.
