# What is Blockchain?
## Understanding how blockchain works is becoming increasingly important in today's digital age. In essence, blockchain is a decentralized ledger system that records transactions and information in a secure and transparent manner. The technology has a wide range of applications, from cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to supply chain management and digital identity verification.

A blockchain is a decentralized ledger hosted by nodes of a computer network. **Blockchains store immutable data in digital format. They guarantee security and fidelity of records, allowing two parties to communicate confidentially without needing a trusted third party**. Effectively, blockchains replace trusted third parties with many computers that share a ledger of transactions or communications. The most common use of blockchain today is to facilitate the trading of cryptocurrencies with help from [cryptographic](https://natureblocks.com/blog/what-is-cryptography) processes. Blockchains also allow smart contracts to be created and executed on their networks.

## Why is it called blockchain?

Blockchain's namesake comes from how the technology organizes transactions or communications. **Blockchain data is arranged into groups called blocks, and these blocks make up a chain**. Blocks have certain data storage thresholds and, when reached, are closed and linked to the previous block, forming a chain of data known as the blockchain. The chain increases in length with each new block committed to it. Another name for blockchain is "distributed ledger technology."

## What does it mean to be decentralized?

Decentralization is the opposite of centralization. It refers to the transfer of control from a single authority to multiple authorities. **The more authorities that control of something is split amongst, the more decentralized that something is**. Democracy is an excellent example of decentralization of power instead of the centralization of power in authoritarian or dictatorship systems. In cryptocurrencies, decentralization refers to how transactions can be completed and recorded by a group of computers instead of centralized banks or other institutions.

## What are nodes, and how do they provide decentralization?

A node is a connection point between computers in a data communication network. For some device to be considered a node, it must be accessible to other devices on the network. **Nodes can create, receive, store, and transfer information**. Node information can also be accessible to computers outside of their network, depending on their configuration.

> For example, proof-of-work cryptocurrencies allow users to commit their computers to the network as nodes and receive some cryptocurrency as compensation for their node's work.

One can visualize Blockchain nodes as small individual servers responsible for maintaining block information. In most blockchain configurations, **nodes facilitate the transparency and security of the public ledger by recording information to each of their local databases**. The more nodes available, the more decentralized and secure a blockchain is. This function of nodes makes the blockchain decentralized and the information immutable.

## What does it mean for data to be immutable?

 By using many nodes that each store the same block information, a blockchain ledger cannot be changed by any individual node or even a group of nodes. **Immutable data is simply data that cannot be changed**. Some blockchains have functions written into the code that allow for protocol changes when a majority of the nodes agree on something in a democratic vote, but others are permanent. Information on specific node functions is available in blockchain whitepapers.

## What are smart contracts?

Smart contracts are an exciting layer that has recently become popular with blockchain technology. Blockchain networks allow smart contracts to exist as applications powered by nodes. They provide a significant amount of utility because they enable individuals to access the computing power of a blockchain and create immutable contracts stored within it. **Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with their terms written directly into their code**, providing the contract the same authenticity, integrity, confidentiality, and non-repudiation as blockchain technology does.
