# What are Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Transactions?
## Have you ever wondered how your data is kept safe when it is transmitted over the internet? In this blog post, we explore the fundamental concepts behind symmetric and asymmetric-key encryption, shedding light on the key differences between the two and how they are used to secure online communications.

## What is a cryptographic key?

All currencies seek to fulfill three main use cases:

1. Store of Value
2. Unit of Account
3. Medium of Exchange

Peer-to-peer (P2P) payments efficiently improve a currency's *medium of exchange* function. **Peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions allow users to transfer funds from their bank account into other users' bank accounts via the internet**. Intermediaries enable these electronic money transfers by verifying the funds before transfer. Often the intermediary is referred to as a peer-to-peer (P2P) payment application.

## How do Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Payment Applications work?

To properly verify a transfer of funds, **peer-to-peer (P2P) payment applications link individuals' payment application accounts to their bank accounts or cryptocurrency wallets**. The data collected from the accounts allows the peer-to-peer (P2P) payment application to pull money from the sender's bank account or cryptocurrency wallet and store it in the receiver's payment application account. Once the funds are in the receiver's payment application account, the receiver can deposit the funds into their bank account or cryptocurrency wallet.

## How do Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Transactions intersect with [Blockchain](https://natureblocks.com/blog/what-is-blockchain) and [Cryptography](https://natureblocks.com/blog/what-is-cryptography)?

Peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions' innately provide unmatched ease of use and efficiency for users. **Besides its user-friendliness, security has been the highest priority of peer-to-peer (P2P) transaction technology** from its inception. No one cares about getting a transfer fast if there is a chance the funds get stolen. Trading security for efficiency will not do.

Traditional banking security standards predicated the first peer-to-peer transactions. However, **[blockchain](https://natureblocks.com/blog/what-is-blockchain) technology and [cryptography](https://natureblocks.com/blog/what-is-cryptography) provide significant security improvements versus traditional banking systems**. Decentralized [blockchain](https://natureblocks.com/blog/what-is-blockchain) ledgers and asymmetric-key encryption give transactions confidentiality, integrity, immutability, and authenticity.

Adopting [blockchain](https://natureblocks.com/blog/what-is-blockchain) technology and advanced [cryptography](https://natureblocks.com/blog/what-is-cryptography) protocols was a natural progression for peer-to-peer (P2P) payment applications because of the aforementioned security benefits.

## How have Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Transactions evolved?

In December of 1998, Peter Theil, Luke Nosek, and Max Levchkin created Confinity's business entity. Confinity aimed to develop security software for mobile computers. Five months later, in March of 1999, Elon Musk founded X.com. From its inception, X.com was an online financial services company. In March of 2000, Confinity and X.com merged to become a single corporate entity.

> Confinity failed to break into the mobile device security market but transitioned to developing electronic payment systems in 1999. Confinity's early money transfer and security systems became the first versions of peer-to-peer (P2P) transfer technology as we know it today.

Musk took over the X.com CEO title from Bill Harris in May 2000 and shortly after (in October of the same year) passed the CEO title to Peter Thiel. The company was renamed PayPal in 2001 and went public in 2002 for $13 a share, raising over $61 million. **PayPal created the first-ever peer-to-peer (P2P) payment application.**

Not long after the IPO, online retailer eBay acquired PayPal for $1.5 billion worth of eBay stock. eBay recognized they needed a transaction intermediary to protect buyers from divulging credit card information and bought PayPal to solve the problem. This high-profile acquisition rapidly increased the adoption of peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions. Almost instantly, more than 70% of eBay auctions accepted PayPal, and a quarter of all closed eBay listings used the peer-to-peer (P2P) technology as a payment solution.

As more consumers became acquainted with the technology, **peer-to-peer (P2P) transfers developed a reputation as the most secure way to transfer funds online**. As a result, many competitors began stepping onto the playing field, including Google Checkout, Yahoo's PayDirect, Citibank's c2it and many more. Today the space is occupied by PayPal, Venmo, Square, CashApp, and a plethora of others. Each has unique features and benefits.
