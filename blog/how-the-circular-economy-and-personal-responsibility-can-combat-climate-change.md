### The Circular Economy and Ethics
The circular economy is an economic system that aims to eliminate waste and promote the continual use of resources. It is grounded in the principles of sustainability, and emphasizes the importance of regenerative practices that support the health of the planet and its inhabitants. At its core, the circular economy is an ethical framework that recognizes the interconnectedness of all living systems, and emphasizes our responsibility to protect and preserve them.

One of the key ethical principles of the circular economy is the idea of stewardship. Stewardship refers to our responsibility to care for the planet and its resources, and to leave them in a better condition than we found them. This requires a fundamental shift in our relationship with the natural world, moving away from a model of extraction and exploitation, and towards one of restoration and regeneration.

Regenerative design, as described by John Tillman Lyle, is a way of approaching design that aims to create systems that are not only sustainable, but also actively regenerative. This involves working with natural processes rather than against them, and designing systems that are able to regenerate themselves over time. By adopting a regenerative mindset, we can create systems that are not only more sustainable, but also more resilient and adaptive.

### Our Personal Responsibility to Combat Climate Change
While the scale of the climate crisis may seem overwhelming, it is important to recognize that we all have a role to play in addressing it. In fact, we have a personal responsibility to do so, as the impacts of climate change will be felt most acutely by future generations who had no hand in creating it.

One way to fulfill our ethical responsibility to combat climate change is to adopt the principles of the circular economy in our personal lives. This can include reducing our consumption of goods, recycling and composting, repairing and repurposing items, and supporting sustainable and ethical businesses. By embracing a circular mindset, we can reduce our carbon footprint and contribute to a more sustainable future.

Circular economy business models, as reviewed and classified by Alfonso Vargas-Sánchez, Francisco J. Riquel-Ligero, and Juan M. Moreno-Manso, offer a wide range of approaches for businesses to reduce their environmental impact and contribute to a more sustainable future. These business models can include product design and development that supports circularity, remanufacturing and refurbishing of products, and implementing sharing or rental schemes that extend the life of products.

Another way to take responsibility for combatting climate change is to become politically engaged. We can advocate for policies and initiatives that promote sustainability and the circular economy, such as carbon pricing, renewable energy, and sustainable agriculture. We can also support candidates who prioritize climate action, and use our voting power to demand change.

However, as Naomi Klein notes in her book "This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs. the Climate," the climate crisis is not only an environmental issue, but also a political and economic one. The systemic changes necessary to address climate change will require significant shifts in our economic and political systems, including a transition away from a growth-oriented economy and towards a more equitable and sustainable one.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, combating climate change is an urgent priority that requires the collective effort of governments, businesses, and individuals. While it is true that systemic changes are necessary to transition to a more sustainable economy, personal responsibility also plays a crucial role. We cannot rely solely on policy and technology to address this global crisis. Each of us has the power to make a difference through our daily choices and actions.

As demonstrated by the research discussed in this article, the circular economy offers a promising framework for reducing waste and emissions, and creating a more regenerative and sustainable economy. However, this transition requires a shift in values and attitudes towards resource use, consumption, and waste management. This is where personal ethics come into play. We must ask ourselves what kind of future we want to create for ourselves, our children, and future generations. Do we want to continue with the current unsustainable trajectory or embrace a more responsible and sustainable way of living?

Taking personal responsibility for our environmental impact can take many forms, from reducing our carbon footprint, to supporting companies that prioritize sustainability, to advocating for policy changes that align with our values. It may not be easy, but it is necessary. As the philosopher William James said, "Act as if what you do makes a difference. It does."

In conclusion, we must recognize that climate change is not our fault, but it is our responsibility to take action. By embracing a circular economy mindset and prioritizing our personal ethics, we can create a more sustainable future for ourselves and for generations to come.
