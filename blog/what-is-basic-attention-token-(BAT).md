As cryptocurrencies go, Basic Attention Token or ticker BAT is one of the most compelling use cases for [blockchain](https://natureblocks.com/blog/what-is-blockchain) technology. Its white paper is dated February 10th, 2021, but has been in development since 2016. The token improves the security, fairness and efficiency of digital advertising. **Users are rewarded with BAT for their attention to ads when browsing with the Brave browser**. Effectively, users get paid for paying attention.

## What is the Brave browser?

Brave browser functions the same as any other browser (like Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge) but has some unique features. **Brave blocks all digital advertisements, allowing web pages to load faster and shielding users from unwanted ads**. In addition, Brave exists on the Ethereum [blockchain](https://natureblocks.com/blog/what-is-blockchain), is open-source, and privacy centred. It blocks trackers, invasive cookies and malware.

## How does Basic Attention Token work with Brave?

When setting up Brave, **users can override the default ad-blocking function and enable advertisements in exchange for small amounts of Basic Attention Token**. In addition, [blockchain](https://natureblocks.com/blog/what-is-blockchain) technology allows Brave to securely and anonymously track user attention. Through this relationship, the combination of technology improves digital advertising security, fairness, and efficiency. The objective of the collaboration is to distribute profits between advertisers, publishers, and users efficiently.

## Why is the use case for Basic Attention Token (BAT) so unique?

BAT allows individuals to claim some of the $330 billion in revenue that the digital marketing industry (featuring giants like Meta, Google, and Yahoo) has monopolized for years. You should receive compensation when you provide a commodity (like attention) in free markets. Therefore, advertisers should compensate individuals for their decision to pay attention to advertisements. **Not only does Basic Attention Token reward users for the attention they pay to ads, but it ensures that only users interested in viewing ads will see them**, which improves the interaction for businesses trying to market their products or services with ads.

> It’s better for advertisers because users who have opted into ads are more likely to be influenced by them, and it’s better for users because they are finally receiving compensation for a commodity that only they can provide—their attention

Websites that receive high traffic are otherwise passively capitalizing on the perceived attention of users, with no guarantee that the users even want to see the ads. Brave ensures that publishers receive compensation only when users engage with their ads and gives users a piece of the pie. Overall, Basic Attention Token is an excellent example of how implementing creative tokenomics can completely change the economics of certain transactions.

## What are tokenomics?

Tokenomics are **an umbrella term for the economics of specific cryptocurrencies**. It is a combination of “token” and “economics.” There are three main pillars that investors are looking for tokenomics to provide, and Basic Attention Token’s use case offers excellent examples of each. Like [blockchain](https://natureblocks.com/blog/what-is-blockchain) technology, tokenomics exist to provide security, transparency, and efficiency.

1. Basic attention token provides **security** to advertisers because they know their ads are only getting shown to users who have opted in. It also provides security to users because they have the option to retain their attention.
2. Basic attention token provides **transparency** to individuals because they know when their attention is purchased and how much compensation they will receive.
3. Basic attention token produces **efficiency** in advertising because only individuals who want to see ads, see ads.

BAT shows how tokenomics can shift the forces of capitalism in favour of the individual, making transactions more secure, transparent, and efficient for all parties involved.

## Who created Basic Attention Token (BAT)?

Brendan Eich created Basic Attention Token as the native token of the Brave web browser. Previously, Brendan Eich created the programming language JavaScript and co-founded Mozilla and Firefox. His current position is CEO of Brave Software.

Brendan Eich has accomplished a lot, but it is important to note that the author and Natureblocks do not support his views. Despite his intelligence and leadership in technology, he is homophobic and has publicly opposed same-sex relationships.
