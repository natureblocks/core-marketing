# How do Voluntary Projects Report Carbon Offsets?
## As more and more companies seek to reduce their carbon footprint, understanding how carbon offsets are reported is becoming increasingly important. In this blog post, we explore how voluntary projects report carbon offsets, providing readers with valuable insights into how these reports are created and verified..

If a voluntary carbon project wishes to be awarded [carbon credits](https://natureblocks.com/blog/what-are-carbon-credits) to sell in [carbon markets](https://natureblocks.com/blog/what-are-carbon-markets) by a non-profit registry, there are many reporting criteria that the project needs to meet. As carbon accounting has many variables that are hard to quantify, carbon emission reduction projects must state specific modeling methods they used in detail. Even voluntary carbon projects produce some carbon emissions, whether from unintended environmental circumstances or simply operators driving to the project site. These adverse effects must be defined as either primary (direct emissions from combustion of fossil fuels) or secondary (indirect emissions from product life cycles) carbon emissions and recorded.

## What documents are required?

Many tests and documents are required before a project can receive any credit for its reduction methodology. First, an overview of the project must describe how the project satisfies the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Performance Standard test. Second, an Attestation of Regulatory Compliance, an Attestation of Title, and an Attestation of Voluntary Implementation all have to be signed by the project manager. Third, project start date and location must be defined and proven with evidence. This data can be verified with dated contracts, including location information either presented as longitude and latitude or as an outlined map area.

## How is the activity of projects made transparent?

Project activity refers to the specific sustainable practices that offset carbon, and these practices must be categorized. For example, a tree-planting project may be categorized as an Improved Forest Management Project or IFM. There are many more categorizations of carbon projects as well. Onsite carbon inventory calculation methodology must be defined because carbon calculations will differ based on the project type. The defined calculation methodology includes location data, sampling procedures, location documentation, measurement tools, and procedures. The frequency and methods for inventory data updates must be made transparent.

## What kind of calculations are required?

‚ÄçBefore starting, projects must lay out baseline modelling for carbon and biomass calculations. For example, a tree-planting project would include the number of trees existing versus the number of new trees planted. How and where collected data is managed must be stated with links to files. Furthermore, any defect calculations or missing data must be documented and explained. Finally, carbon sinks, sources and reservoirs must be identified so that primary and secondary sources of carbon emissions are recorded and subtracted from the total carbon offset to create a net carbon offset for the project.

## What are the maintenance requirements and risks of a carbon project?

An annual monitoring report summary must be provided, including the baseline and project activity calculations anticipated for five to ten years. In addition, projects must state methods for ongoing monitoring of inventory, disturbances, and reversals. Inventory, disturbance, and reversal risk refer to the risk of carbon emissions reverting to above the baseline standards after a project has been certified. Contributing factors to reversal risk include financial failure, management risk, social risks, disease or species risks, and natural disasters. The reversal risk is estimated to create a buffer pool that accounts for fluctuations in carbon emissions. Different project types may require additional risk calculations.

## Wow, that sounds like a lot

It is. Overall, reporting a carbon offset is a complex but necessary process. The plethora of reporting criteria ensures that any [carbon credits](https://natureblocks.com/blog/what-are-carbon-credits) issued are legitimate and deserving projects get rewarded for their work.
