# How can Businesses Benefit from Carbon Accounting?

Profits incentivize private enterprise. Carbon taxes pressure businesses into reducing their carbon footprints. Carbon taxes do this by subtracting from the profit margins of enterprises that go above emission limits. Each year, governments must continue increasing carbon taxes and decreasing emission limits to stay on par with global emission goals. Consequently, **businesses must become more efficient or buy [carbon offsets](https://natureblocks.com/blog/how-do-voluntary-projects-report-carbon-offsets) to avoid increasing taxation**.

Many businesses see becoming more environmentally friendly as an obstacle because of the abundance of negative reinforcement that carbon taxes supply. On top of the profit reduction from carbon taxes, reducing a business's carbon footprint is expensive. Businesses can rarely improve their sustainability for a low price. The up-front costs associated with a company reducing emissions are often more costly than the carbon taxes, so businesses elect to pay the tax instead of making a change. **For a long time, it has been economically illogical to invest in more sustainable practices. [carbon market](https://natureblocks.com/blog/what-are-carbon-markets)s were created to solve this problem by incentivizing sustainability with profit**.

## How do [carbon market](https://natureblocks.com/blog/what-are-carbon-markets)s incentivize sustainability?

Conversely, if another business is over its carbon limit, it can offset its emissions by purchasing and retiring [carbon credit](https://natureblocks.com/blog/what-are-carbon-credits)s. **It is cheaper to buy [carbon credit](https://natureblocks.com/blog/what-are-carbon-credits)s than pay carbon taxes**.

> This function of [carbon market](https://natureblocks.com/blog/what-are-carbon-markets)s allows enterprises to attain competitive advantages in their niche markets by participating in the [carbon market](https://natureblocks.com/blog/what-are-carbon-markets).
