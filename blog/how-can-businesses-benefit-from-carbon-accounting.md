# How can Businesses Benefit from Carbon Accounting?

Profits incentivize private enterprise. Carbon taxes pressure businesses into reducing their carbon footprints. Carbon taxes do this by subtracting from the profit margins of enterprises that go above emission limits. Each year, governments must continue increasing carbon taxes and decreasing emission limits to stay on par with global emission goals. Consequently, **businesses must become more efficient or buy carbon offsets to avoid increasing taxation**.

Many businesses see becoming more environmentally friendly as an obstacle because of the abundance of negative reinforcement that carbon taxes supply. On top of the profit reduction from carbon taxes, reducing a business's carbon footprint is expensive. Businesses can rarely improve their sustainability for a low price. The up-front costs associated with a company reducing emissions are often more costly than the carbon taxes, so businesses elect to pay the tax instead of making a change. **For a long time, it has been economically illogical to invest in more sustainable practices. Carbon markets were created to solve this problem by incentivizing sustainability with profit**.

## How do carbon markets incentivize sustainability?

Carbon markets give businesses positive reinforcement to become more sustainable by allowing them to generate and sell carbon credits. Carbon credits are awarded to any process that shows that it can reduce or recapture carbon emissions. **If a business can stay under their emission limits, they can sell the difference between their limit and actual emissions as carbon credits**. Conversely, if another business is over its carbon limit, it can offset its emissions by purchasing and retiring carbon credits. **It is cheaper to buy carbon credits than pay carbon taxes**.

> This function of carbon markets allows enterprises to attain competitive advantages in their niche markets by participating in the carbon market. For example, one business could be selling carbon credits to its competitor, effectively lowering their profit margins while padding their own. As a result, the business buying the carbon credits from its competitor is motivated to reduce their emissions or continue paying their competition.

Overall, **carbon credits exist solely to incentivize businesses to transition to greener practices by making reducing carbon footprint economically logical**. Carbon credits create a significant opportunity for enterprises to profit from generating carbon credits.

## How can businesses be awarded carbon credits?

There are two main ways that one can generate carbon credits:

Recapturing emissions from the atmosphere
Keeping emissions from being released

If one can prove that they have lowered the projected or current level of carbon in the atmosphere by at least one metric ton using either method, one is eligible to receive a carbon credit. As you can imagine, these two categorizations provide a plethora of options for processes that businesses can complete to generate carbon credits.

## What are some examples of businesses generating carbon credits?

There are many businesses already profiting from carbon markets. One company that's been dedicated to carbon accounting for years is Mosaic Forest Management. Mosaic Forest Management has generated more than 30 million carbon credits from pledging not to deforest land that was previously scheduled to be logged. At the current price of carbon credits (around $20), **Mosaic has generated about $600 million in value** from this venture. That's $600 million that competing companies will need to pay Mosaic Forest Management to avoid paying even more in taxes.

> Recently, Mosaic deferred harvesting another 100,000 acres of land in Coastal British Columbia, earning the title of the largest project of its type in Canada. The trees saved from the project are estimated to capture about 10 million tons of carbon dioxide. Furthermore, the land is home to some of BC's oldest trees, sensitive ecosystems, wildlife habitats, drinking watersheds, and holds cultural significance to coastal indigenous groups.

Another company that has used carbon markets positively is Tesla. **Tesla has generated over $500 million from carbon credit sales just last quarter, according to their latest earnings release**. Not only is Tesla improving their margins with this practice, but they are selling a large portion of their credits to their automaker peers, giving them a competitive advantage.

## What are some examples of businesses buying carbon credits?

Almost every business is in the market for carbon credits because every company produces carbon. Purchasing credits does more than just offset taxes; it also creates a positive public image. Some of the most recognizable names already purchasing carbon credits include behemoths like **Microsoft, Alphabet, Disney, Shell, Salesforce, Delta Airlines, and many more**.

> Some carbon credits are considered "charismatic" credits and include added information about how their processes improve ecological biodiversity or protect sacred indigenous land and culture. These credits sell for more because businesses can use them to advertise their ethical contributions.

Natureblocks allows businesses to showcase their ethical contributions by embedding carbon credits they've purchased directly onto their websites via iframe, displaying where, when, and how each credit was made. In addition, Natureblocks allows enterprises to buy, sell, mint, and onboard carbon credits to provide liquidity to carbon markets.
