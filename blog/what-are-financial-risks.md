# What are Financial Risks?

Risk does not refer to realized loss, but potential loss. Financial risks refer to **the risks of loss or depreciation of capital or assets**.  In financial markets, there are many services and transactions that come with an innate risk of losses. There are many different sources of risk that services and transactions are associated with. When one is trading or investing, these risks must be properly managed to avoid unnecessary losses. These include but are not limited to operational risks, compliance risks, market risks, liquidity risks, credit risks and systemic risks.

## What is Operational Risk?

Every operation has internal processes, systems and procedures that function to meet its objectives. These processes must be protected from fraudulent activities and closely monitored wherever there is potential for human error. All respectable firms perform periodic security audits and have robust procedures for monitoring internal management. **The risks of internal processes, systems, or procedures failing** are operational risks. Operational risk also encompasses natural disasters, such as earthquakes, fires, and tornados because these factors could cause internal systems to fail.

> A great example of operational risk is portrayed in the film *Rogue Trader* (1999). The British biographical drama tells the true story of Nick Leeson, a young Barings Bank trading floor manager who accumulated losses greater than £800 million. He did not have proper risk management training, he hid his losses, and he was not monitored properly by the institution. In the end, his losses resulted in Barings Bank filing bankruptcy.

Although it seems unlikely that modern financial institutions could accrue such losses, the risk cannot be ignored. One key to avoiding such risks is auditing processes, systems, and procedures frequently and diligently. Another key is having backup plans where processes, systems, and procedures are shut down and reassessed when certain loss thresholds are met or extraneous conditions change.

## What is Compliance Risk?

Financial institutions must comply with the rules and regulations of the jurisdictions they exist in and the groups that they are a part of. When rules and regulations are broken, institutions or individuals may face financial penalties for their infractions. **Any financial penalties associated with failing to meet compliance standards are considered compliance risks**.

> For example, insider trading occurs when trades are placed based on material, nonpublic information. Whoever places these trades is not in compliance with their duty to maintain the confidentiality of such knowledge, and often face financial penalties. The specific laws and penalties differ based on the jurisdiction. Another simple example of non-compliance is operating without a proper license.

Service companies or providers like brokerages often adopt procedures to ensure compliance. These can include anti-money laundering processes and systems for knowing the customer better. If a financial service company is not compliant, they can be shut down or face serious penalties.

## What is Market Risk?

Investors are confronted with both indirect and direct market risks in financial markets. Assets traded in markets are constantly fluctuating in value based on the forces of supply and demand. Direct market risk refers to the **risks associated with the fluctuations in prices of assets**.

> For example, if you short a stock and don’t set a stop loss above your entry, you are opening yourself up to potentially infinite risk if the stock increases in price. To alleviate this market risk at a specific threshold and control it, often traders place stop loss orders that will close their position when they feel they have been proven wrong, and are unwilling to lose any more.

Some assets have secondary risks or risks that are less evident, because they are priced based on the fluctuations of other securities or factors outside their primary markets. These secondary risks are referred to as indirect market risks.

> For example, stock option contracts have multiple inputs to how their prices are calculated. These inputs include current stock price, intrinsic value, time to expiration, volatility, interest rates, and cash dividends paid. Although none of these factors directly change the supply and demand forces exerted on the options contracts, they have indirect effects on the participants in the markets who use the inputs to calculate option values if the inputs change. The risk of fluctuation in any of these valuation input categories can be considered indirect risks.

Volatile markets often have more market risk because they are more unpredictable and have larger fluctuations in price. Often managers use specific measures to calculate volatility and create risk parameters to combat the risk it presents.

## What is Liquidity Risk?

Liquidity refers to the ease at which one can enter and exit positions in a market without fluctuating the asset price. If a market is highly liquid, it is easy to enter and exit large positions because there are bids and offers to fill. If a market is not very liquid, it is difficult to enter and exit positions because there are not many bids and offers to fill. If a market is illiquid, it is hard or impossible to enter and exit even small positions. **Liquidity risk refers to the risk of being unable to buy or sell assets without fluctuating the price of the asset and getting a worse price**.  When bids and offers are thin, a trader must settle for worse prices because they cannot get the size they want at their desired price.

> For example, if you are trying to sell 10 cookies for $5, but there is only one person offering to buy 2 cookies for $5, and another offering to buy 8 cookies for $3, you may be forced to settle. Even though the market value of your cookies right now is $5 each, when you actually try to sell all your cookies, you can’t get $5 each because there are not enough bidders that will buy the cookies for $5 each. If you are in a pinch and need to sell your cookies right away, you might only make $34 selling your cookies instead of making $50 because of the lack of liquidity.

## What is Credit Risk?

Credit is the ability to borrow assets with the understanding that the borrower will pay later. In this transaction agreement, entities assume the roles of borrower and lender. Credit risk is **the risk of a lender losing money because the borrower is unable to pay back the lender for assets borrowed**. When a borrower is unable to pay back their loan, it can be referred to as defaulting. Whenever money is borrowed, there is a risk of the borrower defaulting on the loan.

> The most egregious example of credit risk occurred during the 2008 financial crisis. U.S. Banks had lended obscene amounts of credit to individuals who were extremely unlikely to ever be able to pay it back. When borrowers started defaulting on the loans, it created a domino effect that led to Lehman Brothers defaulting and credit risk expanding rapidly throughout the globe. The impact was so great that it catapulted the global economy into what is now termed the Great Recession.

Credit risk does not refer to the risk of a domino effect occurring, but the direct risk of a borrower defaulating.

## What is Systemic Risk?

Systemic risk covers the risk of a domino effect mentioned in the previous example. Correlations between markets and assets are extremely common in financial markets. Certain events can trigger adverse effects in certain markets or industries. **Systemic risk is the risk of a systematic breakdown where small events create much larger effects than what is anticipated**. A common analogy for this is the butterfly effect theory, which is a theory that small things can have non-linear impacts on complex systems.

> For example, if Lehman Brothers was not as widely involved with the United States economy, the effects of it defaulting on its loans would have been relatively miniscule and isolated. However, since Lehman Brothers had borrowed significantly themselves, their default was enough to collapse the entire economy. The 2008 financial crisis presented systemic risks across the globe because of the correlations between markets.
