## What is a cryptographic key?

Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas that traps heat within the earth’s atmosphere. Carbon emissions are a significant contributor to climate change, and the unfortunate reality is that the amount of carbon that humans release into the atmosphere is not sustainable.  Reducing or recapturing carbon emissions mitigates the effects of climate change as well as risks to public health and ecological biodiversity. Many people feel that we have a responsibility to live our lives sustainably and take care of the earth we walk on—which is where carbon credits come into play. **Carbon credits are a new asset class**. Each credit signifies an amount of carbon that is not emitted into the atmosphere.

## How are carbon credits awarded?

Being awarded carbon credits is not as easy as planting a tree in your backyard and receiving a credit. **Non-profit organizations must verify carbon emission reduction and recapture projects.** These non-profit organizations (such as Vera, Gold Standard, and The Climate Action Reserve) all have different methodologies for [verifying projects](https://natureblocks.com/blog/how-do-voluntary-projects-report-carbon-offsets). They use robust testing with mathematical equations to show the market that projects have generated a carbon offset and how much that offset is. Once a specific methodology for testing is made public, carbon emission reduction projects can reuse it in similar projects and processes.

> For example, if you had one tree certified for a certain amount of carbon offset per year, you could use the same methodology to continue to plant more trees and receive the same compensation for each.

## How are carbon credits valued and transacted?

Carbon credits have no universal value because their values are derived from the verification process. **Each credit has a unique value based on the actual carbon offset associated with it**.  Once a non-profit organization has verified a carbon credit, it becomes listed in its registry. Each non-profit has a unique registry, but credit owners can transfer credits between registries in some cases. **Once registered, carbon credits can be traded, bought, sold, or retired**. Since carbon credits do not physically exist, they are each given unique serial numbers that cannot repeat to show authenticity. All of these transactions occur in [carbon markets](https://natureblocks.com/blog/what-are-carbon-markets).

## Is it safe to invest in carbon credits?

Since governments have committed to decreasing the limits for businesses' carbon emissions, the demand for carbon credits will continue to increase inversely to the carbon limits.  Furthermore, as ESG becomes a larger priority globally, individuals are becoming more interested in offsetting their private carbon footprints with carbon credits. These phenomena will increase demand for carbon credits and create [opportunities for businesses](https://natureblocks.com/blog/how-can-businesses-benefit-from-carbon-accounting) and individuals.

## Is it safe to invest in projects producing carbon credits?

Suppose an emission reduction project deviates from its verified process. In that case, it will no longer be able to be awarded credit through the same methodology and therefore won’t receive compensation for work. This system creates a new type of project financing. Instead of investors betting on the efficiency and profitability of a company producing dividends, investors can bet on a verified process producing similar carbon emission reduction results as it has in the past.

> For example, if an existing verification process shows how much carbon is offset by planting a tree (and how many credits are awarded for each tree), one can quickly determine how many credits a tree-planting project will be awarded upon completion, and project value accordingly.

Of course, there are ramifications if carbon emission reduction projects fail to deliver on their promises and get verification of credits. Just as well, [financial risks](https://natureblocks.com/blog/what-are-financial-risks) are present in all markets and require dedicated [risk management](https://natureblocks.com/blog/what-is-risk-management). Still, a project's comprehensive process and goals are transparent before investors assume any risk. Transparency and security of carbon credits can be overhauled by using [blockchain](https://natureblocks.com/blog/what-is-blockchain), [cryptography](https://natureblocks.com/blog/what-is-cryptography), and [NFT](https://natureblocks.com/blog/what-is-an-nft)s.
