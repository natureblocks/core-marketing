Whether it be what to eat for lunch, or how to invest your capital, life is full of decisions. Most of our decisions are simple, but others require thoughtful consideration. We evaluate our choices by comparing the potential reward of each versus the potential risk. This equation is quantifiable as a risk/reward ratio.

Although two options might give you the same potential reward, one may come with significantly more risk. When reward is equal between multiple opportunities, it is always best to take the opportunity with the lowest risk. **Risk management refers to any action, process, rule, or system designed to minimize risk.**

## What must one consider when managing risk?

At the most fundamental level, risk management includes five different processes. These five processes are **goal determination, risk identification, risk assessment, risk response, and risk monitoring.** If one desires to manage the risk of a decision, one must make a plan that engages with the five risk management processes. The more complex the risks are, the more complex a risk management plan must be.

## What is Goal Determination?

Before one can identify any risks, one must have an objective. Once the main goals of an individual or group are defined, they can start to understand the associated risks and their risk tolerance. Risk tolerance refers to how much risk one is willing to take to achieve a goal. If someone is risk-averse, they are less likely to take significant risks.

## What is Risk Identification?

Every action or decision has inherent risks. To effectively navigate these risks, one must thoroughly understand the aspects of an action or decision that present risks. The first step in understanding risk is identifying risks. It is common for some risks to be missed in the identification phase, so the monitoring phase exists to make up for this. However, risk managers should identify all the inherent risks of an action or decision before deciding on a response.

## What is Risk Assessment?

After identifying risks, one must assess the severity and frequency of each risk. Severity and frequency together paint a picture of how potent risks are. Evaluating the potency of the risks allows one to compare the risks to the rewards of an objective. Furthermore, it lays the ground-level understanding for one to begin crafting a response to the inherent risks of an action or decision.

## What is Risk Response?

It is uncommon for an objective to come with no risks. Thankfully, it is more unusual for one to be unable to alleviate some of the risks associated with a goal. Most objectives do not present a viable risk/reward ratio without first responding to risks. Therefore, risk managers must respond to risks with actions, processes, rules, and systems designed to minimize risks.

## What is Risk Monitoring?

Sometimes risks are hard to identify or may not be apparent initially. Furthermore, risks can change over time. For these reasons, best practices for risk management always include continuous risk monitoring. Ongoing risk monitoring allows risk managers to avoid scenarios where risk becomes much greater than one's tolerance and skews the risk/reward ratio.

## What are examples of Risk Management?

By definition, risk management can be as simple as wearing a helmet while riding a bike. In this scenario, bikers must determine their goals, identify the associated risks, assess their severity, decide how they will respond to them, and monitor the risks.

1. The **goal** of riding a bike is both enjoying the ride and getting some exercise.
2. One can **identify** physical injury as an inherent risk to biking.
3. Most bike rides do not result in physical injury, but one can **assess** there is still a chance.
4. Some bikers may **respond** to this assessment by deciding not to wear a helmet, and others might decide that the chance of falling is worth wearing a helmet.
5. As bikers complete rides, they can use this data to **monitor** their risk of injury.

Another example of risk management is abiding by the fire codes of local jurisdictions. Corporate and public buildings are often required to have fire alarms, sprinkler systems, and fire extinguishers in case of a fire. Although managers of the buildings do not desire or expect them to combust, it is necessary to have a plan on the off chance that they do.

## What Risk Management is common in Financial Markets?

In financial markets, risk management covers many strategic practices for protecting capital. **Financial markets present unique risks because they are entirely unlimited environments.** Risks inherent to financial markets are called [financial risks](https://natureblocks.com/blog/what-are-financial-risks). Instead of being regulated by defined environmental limits like speed limits on a highway, market participants are responsible for creating and respecting personal limitations. This limitlessness is unlike almost any other environment that one will encounter in life. In comparison, even gambling is significantly less risky than engaging in financial markets without proper risk management.

> For example, the risks are limited and defined when playing a poker or blackjack game. The start of the game, the end, and the capital at risk are all made transparent before one plays. This structure and limitations inherently prevent participants from becoming passive losers. If you do not specify a variable that correlates with you exiting a trade in financial markets, you may never withdraw your capital and become a passive loser or "bagholder."

There is no beginning, end, or set amount in financial markets that you can lose. Participants must define their beginning, end, and amount of capital at risk. Simple risk management strategies to determine a beginning, end, and risk amount include setting stop losses, take-profit levels, and position sizing. It is best practice to **always have a thorough plan that defines all the possible outcomes of a financial decision before making it.**

Even if one has made a great plan, emotions can still alter one's perception later. Often responses to emotional market stimuli are self-deprecating, which is why **having the discipline to follow a plan is equally essential to having a robust plan.** It is common for participants to set risk parameters dedicated to managing emotions because emotions can often motivate individuals to make poor decisions in financial markets.

> For example, one might have a rule that if they lose a certain amount of capital, they must refrain from making any more decisions and exit the markets until their perception is untainted. Unfortunately, our human emotions often do not permit us to continue making logical decisions after losing a certain amount of capital or consecutive trades in a row. As a result, it is common for traders to attempt to win back their losses by increasing position size, leading to more losses or even blown accounts. Implementing a daily max loss rule allows market participants to define a loss threshold that they are comfortable with while limiting potential daily drawdown. "Day stop" or "max loss" rules are widespread among professional traders.
