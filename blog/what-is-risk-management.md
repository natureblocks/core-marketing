# What is Risk Management?

Whether it be what to eat for lunch, or how to invest your capital, life is full of decisions. Most of the decisions we make are simple, but others require more thoughtful consideration. We evaluate the choices we have by comparing the potential reward of each versus the potential risk. This is often quantified as a risk/reward ratio.

Although two options might give you the same potential reward, one may come with significantly more risk. In a situation where reward is equal between multiple options, it is always best to take the option with the lowest risk. **Risk management refers to any action, process, rule, or system that is designed to minimize risk.**

## What must one consider when managing risk?

At the most fundamental level, risk management can be broken down into five different processes. These five processes are **goal determination, risk identification, risk assessment, risk response, and risk monitoring.** If one desires to manage the risk of a decision, one must make a plan that engages with each of the five risk management processes. The more complex the risks are, the more complex a risk management plan must be.

## What is Goal Determination?

Before one can identify any risks, one must have an objective. Once the main objectives of an individual or group are defined, they can start to understand the associated risks and their risk tolerance. Risk tolerance refers to how much risk one is willing to take to achieve their goals. If someone is risk averse, they are less likely to take large risks.

## What is Risk Identification?

Every action or decision has inherent risks. To effectively navigate these risks, one must thoroughly understand the aspects of an action or decision that present risks. The first step in understanding risk is identifying risks. It is common for some risks to be missed in the identification phase, and this is made up for by the monitoring phase. However, ideally all the risks should be identified before a response is decided on.

## What is Risk Assessment?

After risks have been identified, one must assess the severity and frequency of each risk. Severity and frequency together paint a picture of how potent risks are. Assessing the potency of the risks allows one to compare the risks to the rewards of an objective. Furthermore, it lays the ground-level understanding for one to begin crafting a response to the inherent risks of an action or decision.

## What is Risk Response?

It is uncommon for an objective to come with no risks. Thankfully, it is more uncommon for one to be unable to alleviate some of the risks associated with an objective. Without any response to risks, most objectives do not present a viable risk/reward ratio. Therefore, risks must be responded to with actions, processes, rules, and systems designed to minimize risks.

## What is Risk Monitoring?

Sometimes risks are hard to identify or may not be apparent initially. Furthermore, risks can change over time. For these reasons, best practices for risk management always include continuous risk monitoring. This allows risk managers to avoid scenarios where risk becomes much greater than one’s tolerance and skews the risk/reward ratio.

## What are examples of Risk Management?

By definition, risk management can be as simple as wearing a helmet while riding a bike. In this scenario, bikers must determine their goals, identify the risks associated, assess the severity of the risks, decide how they will respond to the risks, and monitor the risks.

The **goal** of riding a bike is both enjoying the ride and getting some exercise.
One can **identify** physical injury as an inherent risk to biking.
 Most bike rides do not result in physical injury, but one can **assess** there is still a chance.
Some bikers may **respond** to this assessment by deciding not to wear a helmet, and others might decide that the chance of falling is worth wearing a helmet.
As bikers complete rides, they can use this data to **monitor** their risk of injury.

Another example of risk management is abiding by fire codes of local jurisdictions. Corporate and public buildings are often required to have fire alarms, sprinkler systems, and fire extinguishers in case of a fire. Although managers of the buildings do not desire or expect them to combust, it is necessary to have a plan on the off chance that they do.

## What Risk Management is common in Financial Markets?

In financial markets, risk management covers a wide variety of strategic practices for protecting capital. **Financial markets present unique risks because they are completely unlimited environments.** This is unlike almost any other environment that one will encounter in life. Even gambling is significantly less risky than engaging in financial markets without proper risk management.

> For example, when playing a poker or blackjack game, the risks are limited and defined. The start of the game, the end of the game, and the capital at risk is all made transparent before one plays. This inherently prevents participants from becoming passive losers.

In financial markets there is no beginning, end, or set amount that you can lose. Participants must define their own beginning, end, and capital at risk. Simple risk management strategies to define a beginning, end, and risk amount include setting stop losses, take-profit levels, and capital at risk. It is best practice to **always have a thorough plan that defines all the possible outcomes of a financial decision before making it.**

Even if one has made a great plan, emotions can still alter one's perception later on. This is why **having the discipline to follow a plan is equally important to having a robust plan.** It is common for participants to set risk parameters that are dedicated to managing emotions, because often emotions can motivate individuals to make poor decisions in financial markets.

> For example, one might have a rule that if they lose a certain amount of capital, they must refrain from making any more decisions and completely exit the markets. This allows market participants to define a loss threshold at which they are unable to make logical decisions, and are likely to continue losing when crossed. Rules like this are extremely common among professional traders and are often referred to as a “day stop” or “max loss”.
