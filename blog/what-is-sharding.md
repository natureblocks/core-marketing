In blockchain industry dialect, sharding refers to **the partitioning of a blockchain network**. By sharding a network, one can allow databases within the network to process more transactions per second, improving convenience and scalability. Specifically, sharding is the process of breaking a network into "shards" or partitions that are unique and act independently to accomplish the objectives of the blockchain network.

## What are Blockchain Networks?

[Blockchains](https://natureblocks.com/blog/what-is-blockchain) are blocks of data organized into chains in chronological order. **Blockchain networks are networks powered by multiple computers that act as nodes. The nodes process transactions and record them to the distributed ledger as blocks of data organized into a chain.** Each blockchain network has a predetermined consensus mechanism that uses a mathematical formula to decide which data will get committed next. These characteristics aim to provide decentralization, transparency, and immutability of records on the blockchain. It's complex and technical at first glance, but that doesn't mean it's impossible to critiqueâ€”it's far from a perfect system.

## What problems are associated with blockchain networks?

The main problem that blockchain networks face is determining what attributes are most important to their users and then providing those attributes. Not only is the solution a moving target, but one must consider technological trade-offs when accommodating users' desires. As every node must record every transaction on most blockchains, **transaction speed suffers as more nodes host the network and more users actively transact on it**.

> As cryptocurrency popularity has increased over the last fifteen years, increased transactions have forced network architects to make changes to accommodate them.

One can measure the number of transactions of security as volume. Networks can decrease the number of computers processing transactions at the expense of network security to improve speed while experiencing high trading volume. Another option for increasing speed is limiting the number of network transactions. These **unique characteristics of consensus mechanisms make blockchain network optimization a balancing act**. One side weighted with speed and the other with security, network administrators must carry a metaphorical barbell across the tightrope of project-market fit. In practice, this entails engineers modelling and implementing algorithms that make protocols as efficient as possible within the parameters of the trade.

> Networks like Solana and Cardano chose to have less, higher-processing-power computers as nodes to solve this problem. Sharding is another potential solution. Other networks like Bitcoin decided to allow a lower computer standard to become a blockchain node, improving security and slowing transaction time.

## How does sharding solve these problems?

Instead of completely shutting down nodes to increase transaction speed on a blockchain network, network administrators can choose to undergo a sharding process and **repurpose the nodes into partitions with unique functions**. This way, a blockchain network can **retain computing power while reducing the latency on user transactions** recording and feedback.

> Sharding also frees partitions of the network to work on other, different or specialized tasks such as executing smart contracts to mint [NFTs](https://natureblocks.com/blog/what-is-an-nft).

## What problems are associated with sharding?

The problems with sharding are as one would expect after reading thus far: it reduces security. Firstly, when new partitions are connected to a network, **network vulnerability increases because the network has more moving parts that hackers can penetrate**. Second, as nodes functions change from recording transactions, **each node changed is one less record of the decentralized ledger**. Decentralization is one of the most attractive components of blockchain for many users because of its security. However, decentralization is measured differently based on the network's consensus mechanism, as it is hard to compare a proof-of-work system directly with a proof-of-stake system. Theoretically, the decentralization of any network can be measured by how widely value and power dispersed is across multiple parties. Based on this definition of decentralization, sharding innately reduces security.

## How can one avoid the problems associated with sharding?

Blockchain security is not *only* derived from the decentralized ledger but also from the use of advanced [cryptographic](https://natureblocks.com/blog/what-is-cryptography) processes, including [symmetric and asymmetric-key encryption](https://natureblocks.com/blog/symmetric-vs-asymmetric-key-encryption) techniques. Although a blockchain with fewer nodes is less secure, it is safer than most systems because of cryptography protocols. **Sharding has no innate effect on cryptographic encryption and decryption processes and can be used to improve information safety**.

> For example, a network shard might be responsible for sanctioning two-factor authentication or other simple cryptographic strategies.

Administrators can use the shards of a network in many different ways. Intelligent, creative people worldwide find new ways to use partitions effectively daily. Furthermore, most networks have a significant portion of computers dedicated to recording transactions before they consider sharding. A decentralized ledger's **Adding new nodes to new partitions does not compromise immutability**. Instead, the new nodes serve purposes outside of recording transactions. If implemented thoughtfully, sharding can give blockchain networks considerable technological advantages.
