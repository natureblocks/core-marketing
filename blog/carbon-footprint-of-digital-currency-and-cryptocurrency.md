# The Carbon Footprint of Digital Currency and Cryptocurrency
## Have you ever wondered about the environmental impact of digital currency and cryptocurrency? As the world increasingly relies on digital transactions, it's important to understand the carbon footprint of this emerging technology. Join us as we explore the environmental implications of cryptocurrencies and what steps can be taken to minimize their impact on our planet.

Digital currency refers to any currency that can be represented digitally. For example, **any currency able to be transferred online is considered digital currency**. Cryptocurrencies are digital currencies, have many indigenous encryption methods, and are stored on [blockchain](https://natureblocks.com/blog/what-is-blockchain)s and in digital wallets. Both types of currencies emit carbon into the atmosphere during creation and circulation. Each currency's carbon footprint is slightly different because of the systematic differences in how they are traded, transferred, and owned. Most governments are tight-lipped about the environmental impacts of digital fiat transactions, but the environmental implications of cryptocurrencies are public domain. Cryptocurrencies adopt two central systems to manage their [blockchain](https://natureblocks.com/blog/what-is-blockchain) ledgers, and each differs significantly in its environmental impact. ‍

## What is the most popular system that these cryptocurrencies use?

The systems that allow for recording transactions on [blockchain](https://natureblocks.com/blog/what-is-blockchain) ledgers are called **consensus mechanisms**. Consensus mechanisms are protocols that determine how different computers come to a consensus (or agree on) what transactions to commit to a database and the order of the transactions. Most cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, use consensus mechanisms that require mining. ‍

## What is mining?

Consensus mechanisms that use miners are called proof-of-work systems. In proof-of-work systems, miners support the decentralized [blockchain](https://natureblocks.com/blog/what-is-blockchain) ledger by verifying and securing transactions with their computers. Specifically, **mining is when computers guess and test 64-digit hexadecimal numbers to provide transaction verification**. For providing decentralized verification, miners receive mathematically predetermined sums of cryptocurrency for their contributions. These rewards incentivize miners to dedicate their computers to supporting [blockchain](https://natureblocks.com/blog/what-is-blockchain) ledgers.

> One of the main goals of cryptocurrency is decentralization. Miners provide decentralization because they enable a network of individual computers to process cryptocurrency transactions. Traditional financial institutions use a centralized computer or system instead, which makes them centralized.

Essentially, the faster a mining computer can guess and test 64-digit hexadecimal numbers, the more likely the miner will be rewarded with cryptocurrency. Due to these protocols, **the actual function of a mining computer is extremely inefficient** and creates an enormous, arguably unnecessary environmental impact. Over time, mining computers have become trillions of times more powerful and continue to exponentially increase computing power for mining more currency.

## How harmful is the pollution from proof-of-work?

The mining business has become much like running a large data processing center—as long as the payouts cover the cost of electricity, miners will return a profit. As a result, **competition has incentivized the development of massive warehouses full of graphics cards and fans, running 24/7 to guess and test large numbers**. This practice is controversial, especially considering that any currency is only valuable because humans perceive it.

> For scale, each Bitcoin transaction emits the same amount of carbon dioxide as the average US home emits in 75 days. Currently, the Bitcoin network registers about 250,000 transactions each day. On December 11, 2017, Bitcoin traders made over 400,000 transactions in a single day.

In 2020, Bitcoin's carbon footprint was equivalent to New Zealand, emitting about 37 megatons of carbon (according to data from the Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index featured in Digiconomist). In 2021, Bitcoin's carbon footprint nearly tripled to 97 megatons of carbon. Estimates show that Bitcoin's carbon footprint will likely double to reach above 200 megatons of carbon emitted annually in 2022. Releasing the same amount of carbon emissions into the atmosphere as Bitcoin this year would require almost 10 million hours of private jet flight. There are only 8,750 hours in a year, so **it would require 1073 jets flying 24/7 to match the carbon emissions of bitcoin mining**. ‍

## Is there an alternative to mining?

Bitcoin's protocols are unlikely to change, and the annual emissions will continue to increase as more users adopt it. However, some cryptocurrencies have taken a more environmentally friendly approach to their [blockchain](https://natureblocks.com/blog/what-is-blockchain) management. This new approach is becoming the most popular choice in developing cryptocurrency markets. The process that stands to dethrone mining as the preferred consensus mechanism for [blockchain](https://natureblocks.com/blog/what-is-blockchain) ledger verification and security is called **staking**.

## What is staking?

Staking is an environmentally friendly alternative to proof-of-work, called proof-of-stake. As the name entails, **proof-of-stake systems use validators who own some of the currency to replace the role of miners**. Instead of enlisting supercomputers to compete in the guess-and-test Olympics of mining, staking uses simpler consensus mechanisms.

> In proof-of-stake systems, validators contribute to a [blockchain](https://natureblocks.com/blog/what-is-blockchain)s consensus mechanism in proportion to their holdings in the associated cryptocurrency. By staking some amount of a cryptocurrency to contribute to a consensus mechanism, validators are rewarded with a small amount of the same cryptocurrency because their stake provides validation for transactions. One can become a validator by locking a certain amount of the cryptocurrency in a pool where it is illiquid.

Proof-of-stake creates a much smaller carbon footprint because validators are not competing with each other to solve [cryptographic](https://natureblocks.com/blog/what-is-cryptography) puzzles. Validators only require an internet connection and the cryptocurrency they are staking. By using this consensus mechanism, staking eliminates the competition for computing power that creates exponential ecological damage.

## What cryptocurrencies use staking?

Proof-of-stake systems are becoming more and more popular. The most popular cryptocurrencies that use proof-of-stake systems are Solana and Cardano. Initially, the Ethereum [blockchain](https://natureblocks.com/blog/what-is-blockchain) debuted as a proof-of-work system but is now preparing to switch to proof-of-stake in 2022. This shift will be the most significant protocol change in the history of Ethereum and will make the network more sustainable and scalable. Proof-of-stake is the future of [blockchain](https://natureblocks.com/blog/what-is-blockchain) technology.
