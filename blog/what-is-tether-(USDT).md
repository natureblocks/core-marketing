**Tether is a cryptocurrency designed to hold a one-to-one value with US dollars**. Multiple [blockchain](https://natureblocks.com/blog/what-is-blockchain)s support it, and it is exceptionally liquid due to its high trading volume. Over time, it has become an integral element in the cryptocurrency ecosystem because of its unique function. Currently, USDT is the third most traded cryptocurrency, behind only Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).

## How does Tether work with Fait USD?

According to Tether’s original whitepaper, *Each tether unit issued into circulation is backed in a one-­to-one ratio (i.e., one Tether USDT is one US dollar) by the corresponding fiat currency unit held in deposit by Hong Kong-based Tether Limited.* However, this one-to-one relationship has since changed to include other forms of financial collateral to represent the fiat USD.

In simpler terms, **Tether is pegged to the intrinsic value of the US dollar**. The company that supplies Tether owns an equivalent amount of US dollars in its reserves, enabling this USD peg function.

## Why is the use case for Tether (USDT) so unique?

Since Tether is pegged to the US dollar, its use case is very different from other cryptocurrencies. In addition, Tether’s use case is unique because it shows how [blockchain](https://natureblocks.com/blog/what-is-blockchain) technology can intertwine with fiat currencies to increase their efficiency.

The most significant benefit of holding Tether is avoiding the speculative volatility of the developing crypto markets. **Tether provides a stable price level, giving users a less volatile haven to store value**, while still allowing users to store their currency on the [blockchain](https://natureblocks.com/blog/what-is-blockchain).

 > For example, many traders will use USDT as part of a currency pair to trade other cryptocurrencies. This forex-style trading is called pairs trading. If a trader wants to bet that Bitcoin will increase against the US dollar, they can buy the BTCUSDT currency pair to execute their thesis. If a trader wants to bet that Bitcoin will decrease against the US dollar, they can sell the BTCUSDT currency pair to execute their thesis.

By providing price stability with its tokenomics, USDT is considered the first stablecoin.

## What are tokenomics?

Tokenomics are **an umbrella term for the economics of specific cryptocurrencies**. It is a combination of “token” and “economics.” There are three main pillars that investors are looking for tokenomics to provide, and Tether’s use case provides excellent examples of each. Like the [blockchain](https://natureblocks.com/blog/what-is-blockchain) technology that hosts them, tokenomics exist to provide security, transparency, and efficiency.

Tether provides **security** through [public-key](https://natureblocks.com/blog/symmetric-vs-asymmetric-key-encryption) [cryptography](https://natureblocks.com/blog/what-is-cryptography) and the decentralized ledger.
Tether provides **transparency** to individuals because they can access the [blockchain](https://natureblocks.com/blog/what-is-blockchain) ledger to review the previous transactions that wallet addresses have made.
Tether produces **efficiency** in transactions by cutting out the hassle of transferring fiat currency to crypto wallets or exchanges.

Tether shows how tokenomics can creatively change the way value is stored, making transactions more secure, transparent, and efficient for all parties involved.

## What are stablecoins?

Tether tokens have the most widespread public adoption of any stablecoin. Tether adoption is so significant that it is a pioneering concept for all stablecoins. As the name entails, **the objective of stablecoins is to provide a stable asset price**. A stable asset price is accomplished by either pegging the token to a commodity or currency, or creating algorithms to regulate supply and demand forces. Overall, Stablecoins aim to avoid emotional price swings made by the fear and greed of speculators by creating processes to limit and control price fluctuations.

## Who created Tether (USDT)?

Hong Kong-registered company iFinex created Tether. iFinex also owns and operates the BitFinex crypto exchange. They launched USDT as “RealCoin” in July 2014, rebranding as Tether in November 2014.

## What other coins have they tethered to fiat currencies?

There are three other tethered cryptocurrencies that iFinex has created. They are:

1. Euro-pegged coin (EURT)
2. Chinese Yuan-pegged coin (CNHT)
3. Physical gold-pegged coin (XAUT)
