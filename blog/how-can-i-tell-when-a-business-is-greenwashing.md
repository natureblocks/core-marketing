Greenwashing is the act of providing misleading information regarding the environmental sustainability of a company, product or service. **Any unsubstantiated claim that portrays a business, product or service as environmentally friendly can be considered greenwashing**. Greenwashing has previously been termed "green sheen," inspired by the term "whitewashing."

> Whitewashing is corporate jargon for when an organization covers up scandalous facts by presenting a biased representation of those facts. Greenwashing is similar but not as well known.

Often businesses purport sustainability practices and environmental benefits to advertise their products and services. Unfortunately, Greenwashing is so prominent that most environmentally conscious consumers it targets do not believe any corporate claims about sustainability.

## What are some common greenwashing practices?

Any time an organization spends more resources on marketing itself as a sustainable business than actually becoming a sustainable business, they are greenwashing. Companies use many tools and methods to make this blunder, but there seem to be six popular styles of deceit that can categorize almost all instances of greenwashing.

Broad/Vague language.
Many companies advertise with green language that is intentionally non-specific. If a company is planting trees, one should know where they are, what kind they are, and how many will be planted. It is not enough for a business to state that they are planting trees because the broadness of the statement makes it meaningless.

> Nestle released statements about ambitions for 100% reusable packaging by 2025 without tangible goals or processes to make this a reality. It's easy to make claims about the future when the due date is far out, but it's hard to create and execute a plan to make those claims a reality.

Irrelevance.
Companies often make environmental claims that are unrelated to their business operations. These claims could be as simple as taking credit for regulatory actions or actions higher up the supply chain than the business controls.

> Energy behemoth BP rebranded to Beyond Petroleum and put solar panels on all of its public-facing locations, despite making the vast majority of its profits on fossil fuels.

Lack of proof.
Transparency about environmental choices is the cardinal sign of an accountable business. Woefully, most companies make many ecological claims but do little to prove their dedication to sustainability. Instead, find proof or assume it doesn't exist!

> For example, Fiji Water covers its plastic bottles with beautiful tropical ecosystems while the product threatens their existence. It would be more transparent if the bottle were, too.

Lesser of two evils.
It is common practice in advertising to compare one's product or service to another in a way that makes the former seem superior.

> For example, diet soda does not provide health benefits, but it is healthier than ordinary soda—which is terribly unhealthy. In this case, diet soda is the lesser of two evils because it's still not good for you, even though it's advertised as a dieting product. The mind assumes that diet soda is healthy because it compares it to unhealthy standard soda. In reality, a proper comparison would be to a basket of drinks like water, milk and juice.

Hidden trade-offs.
When companies make what seems to be an improvement, they have regressed in other aspects. We are familiar with this because society teaches us that when products become cheaper, their quality suffers.

> Starbucks released a plastic lid in 2018 that was supposed to replace plastic straws, but it contains more plastic than the previous combination of straw and lid. Nevertheless, people still give Starbucks accolades for this change because they are unaware of the hidden trade-offs.

Straight-up lying.
Companies often get away with completely lying to consumers about the greenness of their products or services. To hold businesses accountable, one must think critically about green claims and vote with purchasing power.

> Volkswagen has admitted to tampering with car performance during emission tests to lower emission outputs. As a result, some engines emit up to forty times the limit for nitrogen oxide.

## How can I avoid greenwashing businesses?

Once familiar with the common greenwashing tactics, one can begin to develop strategies to counter them. For the most part, these tactics are made up of **research, studying, and critical thinking. Educating yourself on how you interact with businesses and how your interactions impact them is integral to avoiding greenwashing**. Here are eight tips for avoiding greenwashed businesses:

Analyze company claims closely.
If a company makes aggressive claims, it's always best to investigate them. However, it's more critical if statements influence interactions with the business, which is likely the goal of the claims in the first place.

Certify certifications.
Are the certifications on that product even legitimate? The only way to know is to familiarize yourself with some reputable third-party trade certifications. Some common ones are [Fair Trade Certified](https://www.fairtradecertified.org/), [USDA Organic](https://www.usda.gov/topics/organic), [Rainforest Alliance Certified](https://www.scsglobalservices.com/services/rainforest-alliance-certification), and [Green Seal](https://greenseal.org/splash/)  

Don't fall for advertising.
Advertising always has a specific goal, and it does not necessarily align with yours as an individual. So don't let advertisers shape your decisions unless they provide value.

Beware of common buzzwords.
Companies constantly use eco-friendly, green, all-natural, earth-friendly, non-toxic, plant-based, plant-derived, pure, raw, healthy and organic to greenwash their products. Observing any one of these words should implore one to research their truth.

Ask questions.
Curiosity might have killed the cat, but it helps considerably with sustainability efforts. Asking questions about labels, claims, and statements is a great way to hold businesses accountable, whether it be publicly, privately, or with research.

Seek transparency.
Businesses willing to show you what's under the hood are more trustworthy than those not. Accept nothing less than absolute clarity about your products and services, and companies will have to follow suit.

Buy only what you need.
Besides limiting the plethora of unnecessary waste, limiting yourself to purchasing only things you need reduces the odds one succumbs to greenwashed advertising. Identifying and observing what you need, why, and where it comes from is healthy. It's also cheaper and makes organizing easier.

Look for recyclable packaging.
Packaging is one of the leading contributors to environmental destruction. Therefore, finding and using recyclable packaging is always a welcomed decision. Not only does it help the environment, but it casts a vote toward more sustainable packaging.

## Avoiding greenwashing seems hard. What should I take away from this?

Overall, understanding and avoiding greenwashing requires effort. Researching each business's commitment to sustainability is an ongoing battle. Companies do not make it easy to catch them adding some "green sheen" to their appearances, so it is only natural that this is so. **Being sustainable might not be effortless, but the effort one puts in pays off exponentially with both personal knowledge and global vitality**.
