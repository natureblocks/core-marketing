Natureblocks Technologies Inc. ("**Natureblocks**", "**we**", "**us**" or "**our**") is a corporation formed pursuant to the *Canada Business Corporations Act* (R.S.C., 1985, c. C-44). In consideration for permitting your access to our website and online services and other good and valuable consideration, you agree as follows:

## About Our Online Service

Our Service operates as an online platform for buying and selling digital assets, which as of the last date of these Terms, include **Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, Stellar Lumens, and USD Coin, in addition to those displayed within your Account on the Service** (collectively the “**Digital Assets**” and each a “**Digital Asset**”). We may add additional digital assets to our Service. We may also remove support for, or the ability to buy, sell or exchange existing Digital Assets, at any time. You agree that these Terms shall apply to any additional digital assets added to our Service.

## Custody and Ownership of Platform Currencies

## Appointment

You agree to hereby appoint us to act as the custodian of the Digital Assets in your Account, to be held in trust by us for your benefit in accordance with these Terms, and we accept such appointment and the obligations, duties, and responsibilities set out in these Terms.

## Title & Ownership

The Digital Assets held in trust in your Account are fully-paid assets beneficially owned by you and not by Natureblocks. Natureblocks will record your Digital Assets in its books as separate and apart from anyone else’s Digital Assets and from Natureblocks’s own property. Our records will at all times provide for the separate identification of the Digital Assets owned by each client. Neither Natureblocks nor any third party custodian which may hold client assets on behalf of Natureblocks will loan, hypothecate, pledge, or otherwise encumber any Digital Assets in your Account. Neither Natureblocks nor any third party custodian which may hold client assets on behalf of Natureblocks may use the Digital Assets in your Account in the conduct of its business.

## Depositing Digital Assets, Transactions and Third-Party Custody

You agree and acknowledge that you are the initiator and beneficiary of all transfers to your Account, to the extent that the transfer is within your control. You acknowledge that any incoming transfer not initiated or not requested to be initiated by you may not be released to your Account, until or unless you submit information on the person or entity who initiated the transfer. You also acknowledge that Natureblocks reserves the right to conduct a manual review of your account and any incoming transfer(s), to ensure that the funds can be released to your account. This review period is usually completed within 24 to 48 hours, but it may take longer.

When you deposit or purchase Digital Assets via our Service, they will be delivered and held under the custody of a third-party Digital Asset custodian (“Custodian(s)”). As of the last date of these Terms, we use the following third-party Custodians in respect of various Digital Assets:

As part of the deposit or withdrawal process, we may also use third party Digital Asset wallet providers, including, Fireblocks Ltd. of 221 River Street, 9th Floor, Hoboken NJ 07030 and their affiliated and related entities. For details on their services see <https://www.fireblocks.com/>. As a result of our use of their services, you agree and acknowledge that when you deposit or withdraw Digital Assets they may be temporarily stored with such third-party wallet providers.

Natureblocks has licensed software from Digital Services Limited (trading as CoinCover) (“CoinCover”) to provide additional security for keys to Digital Assets held by Natureblocks using Fireblocks Ltd., including key pair creation, device access recovery and account access recovery. CoinCover is based in the United Kingdom and is regulated by the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority.

In addition to the additional security keys provided by Coincover for Digital Assets held by Natureblocks, Natureblocks has also obtained a guarantee from Coincover for 100% of the client assets held with Fireblocks, excluding losses arising from the gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud of an employee or representative of Natureblocks. The guarantee covers the theft or loss of crypto assets and also includes a software technology solution which monitors and limits transactions and prevents funds from being maliciously taken from Fireblocks wallets. The total aggregated cover amount under the Coincover guarantee is currently over US$19,500,000 and the coverage amount is reviewed periodically by Natureblocks.

To facilitate the ordinary operation of our Service and for each Custodian to reconcile and confirm they hold your Digital Assets, you agree that we may provide each Custodian with any and all of the personal information we have collected from you, including but not limited to your name, email address, phone number, identity documents, identity numbers (such as driver license numbers), bank account and transaction details.

Each Custodian may have their own privacy policy on the collection, storage and use of your personal information. Please contact them directly for details.

By using our Service, you consent to the use of and our integration with each Digital Asset wallet provider and each Custodian to act as a custodian of your Digital Assets. You further consent to the Digital Assets which you purchase or deposit in connection with our Service being delivered to, deposited with and held by a Custodian on your behalf. The use of each Custodian depends, in part, on which Digital Asset(s) you purchase and/or deposit via our Service.

We regularly make delivery of the Digital Assets you and other users purchase on the Service to Custodians and reconcile the Digital Assets you purchase or sell on the Service with each Custodian. To do so, we send and receive the Digital Asset amounts you buy or sell, to or from Custodians. Although times may vary, typically, our delivery to and receipt from a Custodian and the reconciliation occurs within two (2) business days from the date of your corresponding transaction on our Service.

After the reconciliation occurs, you agree and acknowledge that the Digital Asset balances displayed in your Account on our Service are a display of the amounts held under the custody of a Custodian on your behalf.

We do not have access to or control over private cryptographic keys necessary to send Digital Assets from a Custodian’s custody. We rely on the actions taken from within your Account to send instructions, via our Service, to the Custodian to cause any transactions in which your Digital Assets are withdrawn, traded or sold. For details, see the section below entitled, *Withdrawing Digital Assets to External Digital Wallets*.

In order to facilitate quicker sales, trades and withdrawals of Digital Assets, you agree that we may use Digital Assets which we own, to carry out any sale, trade or withdrawal instructions provided from within your Account on the Service. Upon a sale, trade or withdrawal transaction being requested and confirmed from within your Account on the Service, you agree that we shall have your irrevocable consent to instruct Custodians to cause an equal number of Digital Assets to be withdrawn from their custody, which you owned, to setoff amounts we send you, or which you trade as part of such sale, trade and/or withdrawal transaction.

We do not, nor do we purport to have, legal title to or ownership of Digital Assets which are delivered to each Custodian by us, on your behalf, in connection with the purchase or exchange of Digital Assets you make on our Service.

To the extent you purchase or deposit Digital Assets which are held by a Custodian in connection with our Service, you agree to keep your Digital Assets free from any liens, encumbrances, charges, or claims, unless disclosed and agreed to by us and the applicable Custodian, in writing.

You represent and warrant that any Digital Assets you purchase or sell on our Service are being purchased and sold by you directly, and not for or on behalf of any third-party. You are not authorized to use your Account on our Service for or on behalf of any other person or entity.

## Withdrawing Digital Assets to External Digital Wallets

While custody of the Digital Assets you purchase or deposit are held by a Custodian, you may elect to withdraw your Digital Assets to an external digital wallet address. Given the nature of digital assets and blockchain technology, we are unable to confirm who owns or controls external digital wallets address you specify for withdrawals. For your protection, you agree to only withdraw Digital Assets from your Account on the Service to external digital wallet addresses which you own and control, and not to any third-party. You acknowledge that we are unable to retrieve withdrawn Digital Assets, or reverse Digital Asset transactions. To learn more about private keys and digital wallets, please see our FAQ webpage.

As our Service may facilitate the trading and withdrawal of your Digital Assets from a Custodian’s custody, you authorize us to send withdrawal instructions to each Custodian on your behalf. In doing so, we will act as your agent, with the nature and scope of such agency relationship being limited to sending Digital Asset withdrawal and transfer instructions to the Custodian in accordance with these Terms and any actions taken from within (or in connection with) your Account on our Service (including any instructions received via an API, if applicable).

To facilitate the withdrawal of your Digital Assets held by a Custodian, when a withdrawal request is made within your Account, our software sends instructions to a Custodian, on your behalf, to send your Digital Assets to us as part of the transfer or withdrawal transaction. In our sole discretion and in rare circumstances, including where your Account is suspended or terminated, we may also rely on withdrawal instructions from the email address registered for your Account on our service. For that and other reasons, it is your responsibility to ensure you maintain sole and exclusive control of any email address used to register your Account on the Service.

It is your responsibility to ensure that any incoming or outgoing Digital Assets are sent to the correct digital wallet addresses and specify, where applicable, the correct memo or reference code; whether displayed by us in your Account on the Service, or whether the address and memo code are for an external wallet address. **YOUR FAILURE TO DO SO MAY RESULT IN THE PERMANENT LOSS OF SUCH DIGITAL ASSETS, AND YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS IS AN INHERENT RISK OF USING DIGITAL ASSETS.**

Without limiting any other section of these Terms which restricts or limits our liability, you agree that we shall not be held liable or responsible for any damages or losses, howsoever caused (including by negligence or otherwise), which you suffer, arising from or in any way related to Digital Assets being sent to the wrong wallet address or memo code, or the use of a Custodian. If you elect to withdraw any Digital Assets using our Service, you accept full responsibility and liability for ensuring the accuracy of the external digital wallet address and the custody and control of, and access to, the external digital wallet address and related private keys. For more information on such risks, see the section below entitled “*Acceptance Of Risk And Disclaimers*”.

Processing times for withdrawing and making delivery of your Digital Assets via a Custodian may vary based upon the network times of the applicable Digital Asset and each Custodian’s processing times.

## Establishing an Account

To establish an Account you will be required to provide certain personal information as set out on the Service, in our Privacy Policy and these Terms, including for example your name, address, phone number, identity documents, identity numbers, such as a driver’s license or passport number, bank account details and an email address.

*You also agree that all incoming transfers to your Natureblocks Account will be initiated by you, or caused or requested to be initiated by you, insomuch as you can control the transfer.*

If you are establishing an Account in the name of an organization or business, such as a corporation, you will be required to provide:

- articles of incorporation, or similar formation     documents;
- documents indicating your connection to the organization,     such as a current profile report and a director or officer register;
- A list of all beneficial owners holding or controlling     20% or more of the outstanding shares, voting power or ownership of the     entity, along with their respective ownership percentages, addresses and     photos of the front and back of their respective government issued photo     identification;
- Selfies with your identity and a piece of paper that     says “Natureblocks” or other text we may so direct, along with the then     current date; and
- A bank account statement (original PDF downloaded from     your online banking site) showing the legal name of the business or     organization.

We may also request similar documents which confirm the above information, or request further information in certain circumstances.

As part of our measures to confirm your identity (and the identity of each beneficial owner), we may also use third party identification service providers such as Persona Identities Inc. (“Passbase”) and others. To learn more about Passbase privacy practices, please visit [https://passbase.gitbook.io/website-policies](https://passbase.gitbook.io/website-policies/).

We may send copies of your identity documents and personal information to such third-party providers for the purpose of confirming your identity and preventing fraud. In some instances, we may need to speak with you via phone to validate your Account information and your intent to register an Account with us. You agree that we may use the phone number registered with your Account for the above purposes. On such phone calls you must not reveal your Account passwords or passphrases for our or any other service.

Phone calls may be recorded for our own internal quality control and training purposes. To assist us with Account and information validations we may also use third-party service providers. Such service providers may have access to your personal information, including for example, your identity documents, photos you upload to the Service and contact information. Third party service providers may also call you, on our behalf, to assist us with your identity and Account verification.

Upon applying for an Account on behalf of a business or other organization, you represent and warrant that:

- you are fully authorized to bind the business or other     organization;
- the business or organization is duly authorized to     establish the Account with us and enter these Terms;
- you will fully disclose the names and addresses of all     beneficial owners of the business, organization and Account who have a     beneficial ownership or control interest (or other similar beneficial     interest) of 20% or more;
- the business or organization is domiciled in Canada;
- none of the beneficial owners of the organization are     an individual, entity, organization, government or country upon which the     Government of Canada or the United States of America has imposed     sanctions, including but not limited to those listed under the legislation     and related regulations referenced online at <https://www.international.gc.ca/world-monde/international_relations-relations_internationales/sanctions/current-actuelles.aspx?lang=eng>.  

Upon establishing an Account, we grant you a non-transferable, non-exclusive license to access the Service in accordance with these Terms. However, we reserve the right to revoke that license and your access to our Website and Service without cause or justification at any time and without advanced notice. To the extent you have either a Canadian dollar or Digital Asset balance, we will make arrangements with you to withdraw such balances.

You agree that access to our Website and Service constitutes good and valuable consideration in exchange for agreeing to these Terms our Privacy Policy and all other documents and policies incorporated by reference.

If you establish an Account with us, access to your Account is not transferrable and is only intended for you, the individual who established the Account (whether for yourself, or for and on behalf of your organization). As a result, you are not permitted to change the name associated with your Account, nor are you permitted to purchase, deposit or store Digital Assets for or on behalf of anyone else. If you wish to change your address registered with us, we will ask you to provide information to verify your address change including such supporting documents as specified on the Website, or in our correspondence with you.

You are only permitted to hold one Account at a time on our Service. You agree not to establish more than one Account at any time and that we may remove Accounts we deem to be duplicates. In making such a determination, we may consider any personal information you provide to us, or which we have collected pursuant to our Privacy Policy.

You agree to promptly provide us with such information and documents we may request from time-to-time, regarding your use of our Service. This may include the names of individuals you are sending or receiving Digital Assets to or from in connection with our Service, or as may otherwise be required for our compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations.

- You will not use the Website or Service in any way that     intentionally or unintentionally violates any applicable local, state,     provincial, national or international law, rule or regulation;
- Under no circumstances shall you buy, sell, withdraw or     transfer any Digital Assets for any illegal purpose, or in the furtherance     of a crime;  
- You will not send or receive Digital Assets to or from     any individual, entity or country upon which the Government of Canada or the     United States of America has imposed sanctions, including but not limited     to those listed under the legislation and related regulations referenced     online at <https://www.international.gc.ca/world-monde/international_relations-relations_internationales/sanctions/current-actuelles.aspx?lang=eng>;

- You will not circumvent, disable, violate or otherwise     interfere with any security related feature of the Website or Service; and
- You will not use your Account for your own commercial     purposes by sublicensing any rights granted by the Terms or, in any way,     sharing the benefit of your Account with others.

If we reasonably believe you are using our Service for any illegal purpose, including but not limited to, in connection with facilitating transactions involving persons or entities who are under economic or other sanctions imposed by the Canadian or other governmental or international authority, we may terminate your Account and require that you liquidate your Digital Assets and withdraw any Canadian dollar balance to the bank Account owned or controlled by you, or take such other reasonable measures to return your funds, such as, paying the funds into a court where you may claim them.

## Account Security

Account security is crucial to ensure no third party accesses your Account to give our Service instructions to buy, sell, withdraw or transfers your Digital Assets or Canadian funds without your consent or knowledge.

Upon setting up an Account, you will be required to create a username and password.  You are responsible for safeguarding the password you use to access the Website and Service and you agree not to disclose your password to any third-party.  

To protect the security of your Account, you agree to use a unique password for your Account which you do not use for any other online service. As we may send password reset notices, two-factor authentication login codes and links to your email account and/or mobile phone number registered on the Service, you are responsible for ensuring that your email address and phone number provided to us are accurate, private and secure.

We may use your phone number for the purpose of two-factor authentication on your Account and resetting your Account password. You agree to only provide a mobile phone number that is registered in Canada under your own name, which matches the name on your Account. You represent and warrant to us, and agree that you will ensure you are, the sole person, at all times, with access to your email account and the ability to receive SMS and other text messages on the mobile phone number registered with us.

You agree you are responsible for:

- any activity on your Account;
- all instructions provided to the Service from your     Account concerning the buying, selling, trading, depositing and     withdrawing of Digital Assets and Canadian currency; and
- all correspondence provided to us from any email     address or phone number registered with your Account, whether or not you     authorized that activity or correspondence.  

For greater certainty, you authorize us to act upon instructions given from within your Account including but not limited to the buying, selling, trading, withdrawing and transferring of Digital Assets. You agree that we are, in respect of any instructions received from a person using your Account (or accessing your Account in connection with our API), entitled to assume that the person is you; the person or entity’s whose name and personal information is associated with the Account.

You must immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your Account.

You must inform us of any changes to your contact details and other information provided to us, including, but not limited to postal and residential address, email address and telephone number.

## Authorizing Your Wireless Operator

You authorize your wireless phone provider to disclose to Natureblocks Technologies Inc. and its third-party service providers, your mobile number, name, address, email, network status, customer type, customer role, billing type, mobile device identifiers (IMSI and IMEI) and other subscriber status and device details, if available, solely to verify your identity and prevent fraud for the duration of our relationship with you. See our Privacy Policy for how we collect, store and use your data.

## Funding and Withdrawing Fiat Funds from your Account

To buy Digital Assets, you will be required to fund your Account with Canadian dollars.  All Canadian dollar funds are held in a bank Account with an independent bank. Absent any fraud or wilful misconduct solely attributable to us, you agree that you bear all risk related to the banks with which your money is held, and the loss or theft thereof. We make no representations or warranties as to whether such deposits are insured, whether via the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation, or otherwise. We do not guarantee that there will be no risk for Canadian dollar deposits held in connection with your Account within the banking system.

We offer various methods for funding your Account and withdrawing funds from your Account, which may change and be updated from time-to-time. Depending on the nature of your funding or withdrawal transaction, we may permit wire transfers, Interac e-transfers (facilitated indirectly via our bank(s) and their relationship(s) with the *Interac* Association, *Interac* Inc. and DC Bank) and/or direct deposits. We make no representations or warranties that deposit and withdrawal methods currently offered will continue to be available to you.

To facilitate direct deposits and withdrawals, we may also use a third-party provider, Flinks Technology Inc. (“**Flinks**”). Flinks uses an API and other integration features to connect with your bank or financial institution (collectively your “**Bank**”). Upon doing so, Flinks provides us with your Bank Account information, including for example, the name associated with your Bank account, the institution, transit and account numbers, account balance, as well as other information. The information we obtain from Flinks is used to verify your identity, your account information and to facilitate the deposit and withdrawal of funds from your Bank account. For more information, see our Privacy Policy at [https://Natureblocks.com/privacy.html](https://natureblocks.com/privacy.html).

The use of Flinks requires that you provide your Bank login credentials to obtain your Bank account information and to facilitate deposits and withdrawals. Although our Website and Service may display online forms, fields and/or links to enter your Bank login information, we do not have access to any Bank account passwords or other login credentials you submit to Flinks via our Website or Service.  Any data input fields displayed on the Website, Service or linked to from our Website or Service requesting your Bank login information are not hosted by us, nor are the card numbers or password(s) entered into those fields provided to us. For more information on how Flinks operates, along with their privacy policy, visit <https://flinks.io/privacy-policy/>.  

You acknowledge that the Flinks services may not be endorsed or approved for your use by your Bank. Accordingly, it is your responsibility to ensure that you are authorized to provide your Bank account login credentials to Flinks via our Website or Service. Without limiting any other section of these Terms which restrict or limit our liability, you agree that we shall not be held liable or responsible for any damages or losses, howsoever caused, which you suffer, arising from or in any way related to you providing your Bank account information and login credentials to Flinks, any other third-party, whether via our Website, Service or otherwise.

You agree that you are not permitted to fund your Account with funds or Digital Assets which you hold for or on behalf of any third-party. Nor are you permitted to fund your Account with Digital Assets or funds borrowed from a third-party. We may, at any time, ask you to (i) disclose the source of fiat funds being deposited in connection with the Service; and (ii) disclose the source and duly respond to any questions we pose concerning the source of any Digital Assets you wish to, or have deposited or withdrawn in connection with our Service. You agree that we may, in our sole discretion, deactivate your Account and no longer permit the use of our Service based on your responses (or lack thereof) and our policies, including for example, our Anti-Money Laundering Policy. We further reserve the right to not facilitate the sale or transfer of your Digital Assets via our Service without providing you any reason, justification or cause.

You are only permitted to use our Service, fund your Account and withdraw funds from your Account with a Bank account bearing the same legal name and address used to register your Account on the Service.  You are not permitted to use a joint Bank account with our Service or in connection with any deposits or withdrawals. You agree that we may restrict funding methods and funding amounts for your Account.

We do not pay interest on your Canadian dollar deposits, however, interest may be paid by the respective banks with which your fiat currency is held, in which case such interest may be retained by us.

Subject to our compliance obligations, including those arising in connection with anti-money laundering laws, you may, at any time, request us to transfer your Canadian dollar funds to the bank account used to verify your Account. We do not facilitate the withdrawal of Canadian dollar funds to any other account or by any other means. Withdrawal processing times may vary. In the event of a dispute, or in the event we are unable to cause a payment of funds properly owing to you to your bank account, you agree that we may pay such funds into a court, where you may claim them.

## Holds on Withdrawals of Platform Currencies and Fiat Funds

To prevent fraud and reduce risk, we may also, at any time, and without liability to you, place holds on your account, restricting your ability to trade, deposit and purchase Digital Assets, withdraw Canadian funds and/or instruct us to cause a withdrawal of your Digital Assets from a Custodian’s custody. You agree we may also inform regulators and Custodians of any suspicious activity in connection with your account, with the intent of preventing fraud or other illegal activity.

While the Canadian dollar balance of your Account may display immediately or soon after you initiate a deposit on the Service, it typically takes 5-10 business days, but sometimes longer, for us to confirm receipt of your Canadian dollar deposit with our own financial institutions.

For some Account holders, we permit you to immediately buy Digital Assets using the funds we anticipate receiving from you, even though we have not yet confirmed receipt of your Canadian dollar deposit. For that reason, even though your Digital Assets purchased will be displayed in your Account and delivered to a Custodian, we place holds on, and we will not execute any instructions to withdraw the Digital Assets from the Custodian until we confirm your Canadian dollar deposit.

## Remedies for Deficient Account Balances

**IF, FOR ANY REASON, YOUR ACCOUNT IS IN ARREARS, OR A FUNDING TRANSACTION FAILS OR IS REVERSED BY A BANK, PAYMENT PROCESSOR OR SIMILAR ENTITY, RESULTING IN A BALANCE OWING TO US, YOU AGREE THAT WE MAY, WITHOUT NOTICE TO YOU, LIQUIDATE ANY DIGITAL ASSETS ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR ACCOUNT IN ORDER TO REPAY ANY SUCH AMOUNTS OWING TO US.  TO THE EXTENT THERE IS ANY SHORTFALL IN AMOUNTS OWING TO US, YOU AGREE TO PROMPTLY PAY US SUCH AMOUNTS.**

## Buying and Selling in your account

You agree that any order placed (whether to buy, sell or exchange Digital Assets) from your Account and confirmed by the Service shall be final and is not refundable.

However, in some cases, the Service may be unable to facilitate the buying or selling of Digital Assets on a timely basis, or at all, if the accessible market for any Digital Asset has insufficient liquidity or corresponding orders from our liquidity providers.

You further agree and acknowledge that when entering a market order, the quoted price reflects the then current market conditions and that the actual fill price may occur at a price higher or lower than the quoted price, particularly during periods of increased volatility.

## Limit Orders

As of the last date of these Terms, we may permit you to place limit buy and limit sell orders (collectively “**Limit Orders**”). Limit Orders allow you to specify a quantity and price upon which you would like to either buy or sell Digital Assets. Limit orders will remain open until you cancel them from within your Account, however, you agree that we may cancel any outstanding Limit Orders without prior notice to you. We may need to do so for various reasons, including insufficient market liquidity.

You accept all risks arising from our inability to fill a Limit Order, whether due to a lack of market liquidity or otherwise. You further accept all risks arising from placing Limit Orders in which you inadvertently or otherwise specify incorrect or unintended prices.

We may elect to remove the ability to place Limit Orders on the Service at any time. In such an event, your outstanding Limit Orders may be cancelled. While we may provide you with an email or in-Account notification regarding cancelled orders, you agree that it shall be your responsibility to monitor your Limit Orders.

We make no representations or warranties that your Limit Orders will be filled, even in situations where the price quoted for a particular Digital Asset on the Service is at, above or below your Limit Order price. You agree and acknowledge that order fulfilment depends on our Service being able to match your order with prices offered by a third-party liquidity provider and that other orders on our Service, or placed via third parties with our liquidity provider, may be filled first resulting in your order not being filled.

You may cancel Limit Orders until they are filled. As Limit Orders may take time to confirm with our liquidity providers, in some situations there may be a lag period between the order being filled and the time at which the updated order status is displayed within your Account. In such situations, you will be unable to cancel the Limit Order.

In rare circumstances, your order may appear to have been filled in your Account, but rejected by our liquidity provider. In such circumstances, your Account will be updated to reflect that the order was not filled.

We may reject or not permit you to place Limit Orders which are outside a certain range of the then current market price for any particular Digital Asset.

You agree not to place matching buy and sell orders for the same Digital Asset in order to make it appear as though a particular Digital Asset has greater trading volumes, or for any other reason. Where we reasonably suspect you have, or are, placing matching buy and sell orders for a particular Digital Asset we reserve the right to suspend and/or permanently terminate your Account.

## Authorizing Direct Debits and Credits

Once Flinks provides us with your Bank account information, you agree that we and our third-party payment processors and financial institutions are authorized to use that information to process direct debits and credits to and from your Bank account. Such authorization is granted by you in order to facilitate deposit and withdrawal requests made from within your Account on the Service, for the amounts specified in your Account.  It is your responsibility to ensure that sufficient funds are available in your Bank account for each transaction.

The authorization to make direct debits and credits to your Bank account shall remain in effect until you provide us with, and we confirm in writing, the cancellation of such authorization and the termination of your Account on the Service.  You may contact us at [help@natureblocks.com](mailto:help@natureblocks.com) to do so.

To the extent you grant us pre-authorization to debit your Bank account in these Terms (above), you have certain recourse rights if any debit does not comply with this agreement. For example, you have the right to receive reimbursement for any debit that is not authorized in accordance with this agreement. To obtain more information on your recourse rights, contact your financial institution or visit www.cdnpay.ca.

We use third parties to process all direct debit and credit transactions with your Bank. We make no representations or warranties as to deposit and withdrawal timeframes or the ongoing availability of direct debits and credits as a funding or withdrawal option on the Service. Although funds may be withdrawn from your Bank account, or your Account on the Service, such withdrawals may not appear or be available for use on the Service, or in your Bank account, until the transaction clears the applicable financial institutions and we can confirm the transaction.

We keep audit logs of transactions both on our Service and related to the deposit and withdrawal of funds from your Bank account (the “**Logs**”). If required by law, and in order to cooperate with any investigation into any criminal acts or misconduct, we may share the Logs associated with your Account and other personal information we collect from you with government agencies.  You acknowledge that we may, and that we may have an obligation to, report suspicious transactions and transaction for amounts above certain thresholds with various government agencies and authorities, without notice to you.

In connection with reporting or other compliance obligations, we may disclose the details of any transactions, whether for the buying, selling or transferring of fiat funds or Digital Assets to applicable regulatory agencies, including but not limited to regulatory agencies that govern anti-money laundering laws in Canada, such as The Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC), see <https://www.fintrac-canafe.gc.ca/intro-eng>.  

You acknowledge that we may report the details of certain types of transactions, large transactions and/or suspicious transactions conducted in connection with your Account (including your name and the transaction or transfer details such as the amount, digital wallet addresses and name of the intended recipient, if known) and in doing so, shall have no obligation to give you notice thereof.
 We may also be required to respond to subpoenas, court processes and information requests we receive from government agencies and authorities, whether pursuant to the *Income Tax Act, RSC 1985, c 1 (5th Supp)* or any other applicable legislation in Canada. You agree that we may respond to such requests with your personal information and Account details, where we are required to do so by law. See our Privacy Policy as well for details.

## Fees

As of the last date of these Terms, we do not charge fees in relation to buying or selling Digital Assets, however, we reserve the right to do so. If we elect to introduce fees in relation to the Service, we will provide at least fourteen (14) days’ notice of the implementation of those fees on the Website and/or Service.  

To cover network fees and other costs, we do pass along the fees to facilitate the withdrawal or transfer of Digital Assets to an external wallet address. For details, please see your Account.

### How we make money

While we do not currently charge Account fees, or maker or taker fees, we do make money from the price spread at which you buy and we sell or we buy and you sell, Digital Assets, often called the “bid-ask spread”. In short, we keep a small spread between the price we quote for the purchase or sale of Digital Assets in your Account, and the amount we pay our own liquidity providers. We dynamically change the “bid-ask spread” proportion to the current environmental impact of the Digital Assets being bought or sold.

### Taxes

You acknowledge that buying and selling Digital Assets may give rise to taxable gains and/or taxable losses, which you are likely required to report for tax purposes. You are encouraged to obtain professional tax advice in connection with your tax filing obligations arising from the buying and selling of Digital Assets. For general information about the taxation of cryptocurrencies published by the Government of Canada, please see <https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/programs/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/compliance/digital-currency/cryptocurrency-guide.html>.

Although we may offer functions on the Service to calculate gains or losses, you are responsible for confirming the accuracy of such functions and reporting your gains and losses as required by law to the appropriate authorities.

We make no representations or warranties as to the accuracy of any such reports, which, in accordance with the disclaimers below, are provided on an ‘as is’ basis.  You use such Account functions and reports at your own risk.
